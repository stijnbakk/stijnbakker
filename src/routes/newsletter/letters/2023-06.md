Welcome to this first edition of my newsletter! Feel still a bit awkward to be putting out my thoughts like this, but I'm excited to start this experiment. I wrote a little bit about [why I start this newsletter](/writings/why-a-newsletter). In short; as an accountability tool for myself to make all the things I view, think and note down concrete, and hopefully provide you with a bit of value.

In this edition, I'll talk about Apple Vision Pro, surge of generative AI integrations, AirBnB's purge of product managers and a lot more. Let's dive right in!

## The true driver of spatial computing: SwiftUI

Apple invented 'spatial computing'. And it will be a gamechanger. Not because of Vision Pro, but because of **SwiftUI**.

Let's back up a bit. Apple introduced a pair of AR glasses, in the most Apple way possible. They rebranded AR into 'Spatial Computing'. And I think the Vision Pro will be a gamechanger. But a slow one at that.

Apple is betting on Spatial Computing as a next paradigm after _desktop computing_ and _mobile computing_. What the hell is spatial computing? Nobody knows quite yet. But a lot of people (including me) are excited - some sign that there might be some value there.

Vision Pro will kickstart the invention of what spatial computing means. Not because you can watch photos, videos and facetime with googly eyes on top of a pair of skiing goggles.

**SwiftUI** is the real innovation here. The driver of _spatial computing_. SwiftUI is Apple's way of creating an interface with code. A bit like HTML and CSS, but Apple-style.

And SwiftUI makes it incredibly easy to make beautiful apps. As a developer you can tap into a fast ecosystem of libraries you need to manage data and use frequently used services like maps, and tap into the App Store distribution model to monetise your app. This way

## EU's step towards regulating AI: don't shoot yourself in the foot

Genie is out the bottle.

Try the carrot, instead of the stick.

EU is scrambling to regulate AI. Too late. Why? And how?
Every politician is all panicky because of ChatGPT. Why? Because people don't understand it, yet it seems earily human. "Job displacement" is buzzing all around. Whether that will actually become reality is irrelevant, now we're in a race to regulate AI as quick as we can.

The genie is out the bottle. And EU, as much as you'd want to regulate training data, algorithms and hosting providers of open-source models, you can't put the genie back in the lamp.

## The end of (product) management is near?

AirBnB purged its product managers overnight. Why?

## EU regulations attempt: trying to hold water with only your hands

EU has jumped in the global political race to regulate the scary tech of articial intelligence. The act focuses on 3 things primarily; ensuring

## Slurry of generative AI

## On my radar

## Awesome stuff I'd like to share:

- Brilliant interactive 3D explainer blog-posts on everything from mechanical watches to GPS signals on ::Chiechanow's website::. [Check it here](https://ciechanow.ski/gps/) (and please do take the time to really deep-dive into an article) website

- EU regulation act
  - What, so what, now what?
- Out-there takes
- My takes on the hot topics
  - Generative AI slurry announcements:
    - What: Figma, MidJourney, OpenAI app store, Notion, Adobe Firefly - generating designs, text, images and videos is advancing rapidly.
    - So what: impressive tech, but that's not the interesting bit. It is a very powerful enabler for primarily marketing, which is a big painpoint for companies, but that's not the exciting bit. It is interesting
      - Yet at the same time I have the feeling, like with a lot of platforms, that it is sort of ductaped together. Remember the website builders of the 90s, with their impossible-to-read code?
      - A lot of fuzz around copyright stuff - I'm not too worried about that.
  - [[Apple Vision Pro]]:
    - the launch of a new platform, not yet a platform. Primarily excited about the ease of programming Apple enables, thus enabling developers and designers to free up their thinking. Eventually this will lead to applications that are so valuable to actual users that by the time the tech is so light and wearable, it will be a no-brainer. Particularly for business applications - developers work anywhere with multiple displays, augmentation. Industries locked in to non-tech will be left behind, as always (article). They will stick to Microsoft Word and Excel for another 30 years.

- Thoughts I have
  - Figma launched AI (surprise) - generatively designing based on design best practices. But what will it do to originality?
- Things I'd just like to share because I'm excited about them

* Things I keep an eye on to maybe ever become trneds
  - [[AirBnB]]'s latest move to make product management fully redundant overnight. What, how and why? Personally I can't wait till we purge process managers, product managers and project managers.
