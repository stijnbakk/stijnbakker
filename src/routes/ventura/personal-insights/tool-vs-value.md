# Tool vs value

I'm a tool guy. I like tools and gadgets and trying out new things.

I get trapped into believing that they somehow might make me more productive or better.

I've too many todo-apps to know that that is really not true. Sadly.

I've accepted that about myself, sort of.

Yet it is a theme that comes back again and again. I like tools, new shiny things, gadgets.

And that also means I like the people who like tools and gadgets, and the people who create those.

And why am I writing this?

Because I know full well that a tool is going to make you a bit more productive (as a person), but it won't really.

However, on the other side of the spectrum are the real problems to deal with.

For most businesses the pain of having to do administration is not as big as having a plan and a system to generate leads, get more sales out the door, more cash in.

Yet I want to make the administration tool, not the site builder, ad analytics platform, or any other marketing tool.

That is what I'm now learning.

And I'm reminded of one of the lectures of StartUp School, where the teacher states - find a real and valuable problem to solve instead of falling in love with the subject matter of that problem. Because whether you're running a niche gaming website, or managing a specific tool for construction companies - your day-to-day is going to look the same. You're going to be designing, coding, and maintaining some software system.

I take some issue with that statement, because it feels a bit hopeless.

It also rings true.

A product is worth nothing is people aren't buying it. And people won't buy unless it solves a fundamental need (except for the early-adopter peeps like me, who try things just for the sake of trying).
