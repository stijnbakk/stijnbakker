Wrap-up of W26-2023, halfway through (thursday)

Exciting week! First week to really push myself to get cracking. Thus far I've only logged 14,75 hours, but already I felt it time to wrap up the week with 4 defined search areas and boundaries. I defined that I want to explore 4 areas further, and I've found that within those areas I must look for opportunities that leverage my experience in design and turning designs into products (instead of for example advanced tech or advanced branding/marketing).

Let's have a look at the week

## Assignment of this week:

> Assignment this week: define a set of core search areas that actionably focus further research into a direction that seems long-term inspiring and economically viable

## Deliverables of this week

- 5 search areas defined
- "Skill-interest sweetspot"
- "Ambition-asset sweetspot"

### 4 search areas

#### Search area 1: Everyday software tools for prosumers

> The digital tools we use everyday can be a lot more simple, beautiful and useful if we leverage the native APIs

- Research question
  - What tools are used everyday, in which distribution on Apple platforms?
  - What is the state of Apple SDK ecosystem, is it growing? What are the economics
  - What is general willingness to pay for daily well designed tools, specifically for Apple users? What is considered a impulse buy? What are expectations around price, maintenance, features and communication?
- Hunges and notes
  - Hunge: Apple SDK is a unique opportunity for creating beautiful apps, with not a lot of back-end cost, easy improvements of user experience, distribution and marketing of the product - very interesting for a small business. Very interesting as well as the ecosystem seems to be growing.

#### Search area 2: Easy business

> Starting and running a business should be eas, enabling you to focus on your craft. This means streamlining the back-office and lead generation - what opportunties are there? In particular - what could be the benefits of a simplified more flexible ERP system for SME?

- Research questions
  - What are the core challenges of SMEs in starting up?
  - What are the core challenges of European SMEs in staying operational?
  - What are the tools large companies use to manage these challenges that SMEs might benefit from? What is keeping them from benefitting?
  - How do SMEs currently solve those challenges and what would the unit economics need to look like to make a switch for them viable?
- Hunges and notes
  - All in one website, mail, etc.
  - Flexible Notion like software for enabling streamlining of 'backend' of businesses

#### Search area 3: EU specific digital tooling

> Core digital services businessse rely on are often US based - from a geopolitical point of view, can we create a competing alternative, that combines excellent design to 10x the value and offer a strategically and geopolitcally advantage?

- Research questions
  - What are the core digital services that large and small companies alike rely on and in which distribution?
  - Which of those services are US based? What elements of those services can be copied to build a European alternative that is also fastly more usable?
  - What political shifts are on the horizon that might compell companies to switch in the upcoming years
- Hunges and notes
  - Cloud hosting, ERP software, etc
  - More research necessary

#### Search area 4: Creative tooling for design, writing and collaboration

> Digital tools for processes like creative thinking (Muse), collaboration (Miro), publishing (Ulysses), service design (TheyDo), etc.

- Research questions
  - What mental models for creating digital stuff are becoming more mainstream (e.g. spacebar for spatial canvasses) that might indicate a unmet need or opportunity? (local-first, collaborative, spatial)
  - What creative tools are generally used for which ultimate purpose in which distribution?
- Notes and hunges
  - Hunge: mental models becoming mainstream: a move away from cloud and towards local first, collaborative as a critical feature, (economic) valuation of niche tools, code syntax now more approachable (combi of userfriendly tech like Tailwind/SwiftUI and ChatGPT)
  - A desillussion with generative AI as it gets everywhere
  - Tools to look at: Jira, Figma, LinkedIn, Miro (stuff you have to use, but don't want to)

#### Search area 5: Legal tech

> Making legal stuff more accessible, understandable and trustworthy is a worthy endeavour for both enabling businesses, and enabling the legal system to remain healthy and trustworthy

- Research quesitons
  - How much of a pain is legal stuff really for SME entrepreneurs? What makes it painful?
  - What are upcoming regulations, and also enabling technologies that could disrupt the space?
- Hunges and notes
  - Platform for finding specialised trustworthy professional services
  - LLM tooling for legal work
  - LLM assisted search of patents and trademarks

## What's next

Assignment for week 2: **a full defined set of search areas with documented problem statements, reported insights and opportunities and a initial draft version of a potential/excitement matrix for ideas, solutions and problems to solve, ready for validation of the problem statements with target audiences.**
