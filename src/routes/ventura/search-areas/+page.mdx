# Search areas

What is a search area?

It is a more specific domain in which you can start to understand the challenges and painpoints of target users.

It's a boundary, a choice to limit your focus, enabling you to go deeper.

As such, a search area doesn't really have a fixed format (unlike a _brand positioning_, _problem statement_ or _value proposition statement_)

The requirement of a

This is a initial list of search areas:
- **Everyday simple tools that could have a massively better UX**: inspired by Muse, Ulysses, Raycast, Things, Fantastical, Screencast - these are the tools you use everyday, don't really think about, but are really valuable. Where are the painpoints, for who? And how do the economics of these products work?
- **Easy business**: starting and running a SME business should be easy, enabling you to focus on your craft. This means streamlining the back-office and lead generation - what opportunities are here? Particularly - what could be the benefits of a simplified more flexible ERP system by for SME?
- **Legal tech**: making legal stuff more accessible, affordable and trustworthy I feel like offers a lot of opportunities, and is badly needed in this world
- **EU specific digital tooling**: there are a lot of very useful fundamental digital services for businesses that do not (yet) have a European equivalent. Think of a good cloud provider, admin systems. What are the systems most businesses rely on? And is there a case to be made 



What is the next step for research?

Key is to understand 1) the painpoints in the domain and 2) the opportunities in the domain upcoming in terms of trends, legal upcoming changes, and enabling technologies of last couple of years.

Furthermore, for each search area there are more specific questions to look in to:

### Quick note on some scoping already
You might see some patterns, scoping stuff. I more or less already made some scoping decisions:
- Business > consumers -- I feel like businesses are more easily willing to spend money on (digital) services. See also [my thoughts on this](/writings/expense-investment) in my blog
- Single platform, or more accurately either internet based or Apple based. Internet because I know it well. Apple SDK because it has a lot of engineering and marketing/distribution benefits, also the product economics of the demographic of Apple device users seem to be better

## Other sidenote
Another search area that heavily has my attention again and again is _work augmentation_, or _decision support_. Basically the quest to replace (middle) managers with software.
However, I also realise that might be a bit more of a fanatical ideology than actual search area. So for now,I've cut it out. 

## Assets and skills (for opportunity hunting)
In addition for understanding opportunities I need to understand my USP and skills

What I believe it comes down to with me is being able to create a hyper simplified optimised user experience through a deep understanding of the value of what the user is trying to get at. A combination of understanding users, being able to abstractly turn that into a replicable process, being able to turn that into a simplified 'feature', and turn that into something that is also beautiful.

Futhermore, my skills come down to:
- Great copyrighting, visuals and storytelling
- Envisioning and evaluating beauty, creating designs
- Translating designs to engineering, to be created (by myself)
