**TLDR:**
- Digitisation is a belief in the economic potential of digital technology. It is about a (National) effort to prepare society to grasp those advantages (and stay competitive in a global market.
- At the root of digitisation lies the concept of digital technology. At the core that concept is unintuitive and difficult to wrap our heads around. This can be compared to learning math in primary school. And much like being pressured to do math, a similar pressure to use digital technologies causes anxiety and resistance in people. This makes digitisation more difficult from a governmental point of view.
- It’s the emotional forces of digital technology that make digitisation of nations such a monstrous effort to undertake. In particular in Germany, where traditional values are deeply engrained in society and economy.
- Government can only do so much to facilitate digitisation of economy, ultimately this has to come from adoption of (SME-)businesses of affordable digital products and services that improve efficiency, combined with a shift in (local) market competition that incentivises those (SME-)businesses to innovate.
- The ‘foundations’ of digitisation in Germany (infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, e-government services) are now rapidly being developed by the German government. But ultimately the real economic benefit will have to come from a significant shift in market competitions, directly felt by the large pool of SME businesses in Germany.
- Significant opportunities revolve around making it easy and affordable for SME businesses to implement digital (business management) software. For example through affordable development services, or standardised/customisable solutions.  

“Digitisation” is in vogue. Politicians like to throw it around, so do executives and managers. “Digitisation” gets hyped as saviour of our economy, and blamed as the displacer of jobs. But what the hell is digitisation really? How can we best think about it? And why does it even matter? 
In this essay I want to try and better understand that topic. In particular the digitisation of Germany, Europe’s largest economy. I do so by dividing the essay into three parts. Part 1 explores the concept of digitisation, and provides a framework how best to think about it. In part 2, we use that framework to look at the digitisation of German society and economy, what challenges it causes. In part 3 we extract the challenges from part 2 into (business) opportunities and trends to keep an eye on.

## Understanding digitisation
What is digitisation? If you look it up you get a definition of [turning analogue info into digital info](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/digitization#:~:text=%2F%CB%8Cd%C9%AAd%CA%92%C9%AAt%C9%99la%C9%AA%CB%88ze%C9%AA%CA%83n%2F,and%20processed%20by%20a%20computer "Noun: Digitisation"). Basically, scanning stuff.

What is meant here is more specifically the ‘digitisation of economies’. By this we mean the ‘interweaving’ of digital technology in all aspects of society. In how we do business, trade, interact with each other and our governments.

But that still is a bit vague. And to understand the challenges of digitisation we need to first understand how digital technology is a counter-intuitive concept for our brains.

### The counter-intuitive nature of digital technology
Do you remember the feeling in primary school of being totally confused about numbers? About the concept of math? It might feel natural now, even ‘logical’, but math is in many regards a counter-intuitive concept to wrap our heads around. As a society we recognise its potential, and mandate children it to be taught. 

Digital technology is similar. In many ways it is unnatural. I won’t go into the nitty gritty of what digital actually means. Just understand this - digital technology enables these two key things:
- Omnipresence: Information can be distributed globally in an instant. That means we are expected to be in multiple places at the same time. We can Zoom with colleagues whilst being at home, with a concert on in the background, access to all the information in the largest library in the world via Google. This is a lot to wrap your head around. Quite difficult to do actually. Ever tried to have a conversation with a real-life person while also reading the news and/or messaging a friend?
- Omniscience. Information can be collected, processed and stored basically without limit. That means we’re (particularly in business) expected to be able to weigh all information possible before we make a decision. We can only store so much in our heads at any one time. We get a sort of decision paralysis - knowing we might have missed something in the data stresses us out. It’s just unnatural to hold so many ‘variables’ in your head.
These two unnatural things cause ‘friction’ in our brains. And that friction evokes emotions (more on that later). Some people love it and have no problem with it whatsoever, but most need to learn these concepts. Similar to how we had to be taught math. 

### Maslow’s pyramid of digitisation
Now we have a bit of a framework for understanding digital technology, we can start to look at digitisation of an economy. 

You can think of digitisation as the efforts of a society to maximally take advantage of the nature of digital technologies and how they will develop in the coming years. It is about making society and economy flourish, by grasping the opportunities that are made possible with digital technology. Ultimately that is about trade and value creation - our economy. 
Understanding that, we can ‘model’ the elements of digitisation as a sort of Maslow  pyramid. Where at the bottom sit the elements that enable digitisation, and at the top sits a flourishing economy and society.

![MASLOW PYRAMID OF DIGITISATION](/writings/digitisation-germany-and-europe/maslow.svg)


At the bottom sits two things: infrastructure and ‘digital literacy’ Infrastructure because without a digital device, and basically also a speedy network connection, we miss out on the two core enablers of digital technology. Digital literacy we can think of as the most basic understanding of how to use that technology - ie. touch input (for phones), concept of a keyboard, maybe a mouse, and key concepts like selecting, moving through views. 

On top of that base layer we can start to add a regulatory framework. 
Then we can start to add the key enabling services that almost every interaction using digital technology (in an economy) relies on. 

On top of that come the ‘soft skills’ - the cosy bed for innovation. And ultimately, all of the services and products. Be it digital products that enable business processes (like a robot arm, accounting software), or more focused on consumers (webshop). 

All of these elements in the pyramid are interdependent. You might argue you don’t need them all to start a particular business. But overall for a flourishing economy you could argue you need them all. 

### Why digitisation is important and people talk about it
Digitisation is about leveraging digital technologies - being ready to capitalise on the benefits it provides. It is about creating a paradigm shift - learning a new language; just like we as a society taught ourselves the basics of math.

That means that, much like with the concept of ‘math’, we intuitively acknowledge that digital technology holds potential. We don’t know what exactly, but we feel sure we can get benefits out of it. It’s a bit like a cult in this way. And like how an ideology spreads across the members of a cult, the wish to digitise (and not lose out on the benefits) spreads across countries (and businesses, ideally, more on that later).

## Germany’s digitisation
That brings me to Germany. In my writing I generally focus on the overlap of tech, entrepreneurship and policy for Europe. And within Europe, Germany is a bit of an odd duck when it comes to digitisation.
Some, maybe a lot, of people say that Germany is lagging behind in comparison to other countries. . That’s not for me to judge. What is interesting is the particular challenges of Germany in digitising the nation. 

You see, the traditional culture in Germany work as a bit of a break on the hype around digitisation. It breaks the mold a little bit.

### Why is Germany’s digitisation relevant at all?
But before I get into that, let me elaborate a bit on why Germany is interesting to look at. 
It is Europe’s economic powerhouse. Largest economy of Europe, fourth largest in the world . The extent to which Germany is able to digitise determines the extent to which Europe is able to compete on the global market. 

In addition, by its sheer size and economic relevance, the ‘way’ Germany decides to digitise will set the tone for EU policy around the topic. And in turn the EU ‘regulatory framework’ (generally the strictest globally) determines the attractiveness of Europe as a market, as well as how businesses worldwide digitise . It’s a trickle up effect of policy.   

Thirdly, Germany is a culture where traditional values are deeply ingrained. Because digitisation is such a paradigm shift, what we can witness in Germany over time, is the understanding of how a society and digital technology can really coexist. 

This means the digitisation of Germany is a key development to watch to understand both the geopolitical position of Europe, as well as the general direction that global digital products and services will develop.

### Challenges
A nation’s efforts to digitise can be initiated by government, pushed ‘upward’ through Maslow’s pyramid of digitisation. But ultimately, it is up to the businesses to reap the real benefits of digital technology, and let those trickle down into the economy.

This is where things are particularly challenging for Germany. Because the types businesses Germany relies on, do not feel a particular incentive to innovate, nor are there easy digital products for them to implement. Add to this that the German government is not really able to ‘push’ for changes, and you get a digitisation effort that is running into the ‘last-mile’ problem.

#### Let’s unpack that a little bit
To understand Germany’s digitisation challenges you must first understand two things - Germany’s (relatively) high focus on traditional values, and the type of businesses their economy is built on.

##### Traditional values
I’m going to grossly oversimplify here (sorry Germany, I love you) - In many regards Germany is a conservative, calvinistic country. Keep your head low and work. The country generally has a deep-grounded appreciation for traditional values. And much of how education and businesses are setup, is based on those values.

Germans are traditionally skeptical of government, and the country is politically largely organised in a decentralised manner. That is the first hurdle for the government-driven effort to digitise this country. It is unable to do a hard top-down push on ‘states’ (Bundesländer).

Second challenge is the very nature of digital technologies. Being mandated to use them is like being mandated to use math, it easily rubs you the wrong way, and causes you to retract in the ways you have always lived your life. That reflex is easy to understand, but means as a government you’re unable to push strongly directly towards businesses or citizens.

Third is more to do with an (un)healthy skepticism of this new and unknown thing. In particular around privacy. Privacy is a tricky subject to get right, but nonetheless it is a prerequisite for people to start trusting (and start using) this new technology. It’s a chicken and egg problem, the problem centred around trust. And trust takes lenghty process to build, can’t be forced.

All of this means that a national ‘top-down’ push to digitise is likely to rub people the wrong way, slowing down digitisation even further.

#### Businesses
Ultimately as a government you can facilitate only so much. Ultimately your economy relies on businesses to create value. And this is where the ‘efforts’ around digitisation must bear fruit. But this is also the biggest challenge for Germany. It is like the last-mile problem of digitisation.
Germany relies heavily on two types of businesses: industry and ‘mittelstand’ (SME). Both move relatively slowly and steadily. They make Germany into the (slow moving but reliable) diesel of the European economy. And they make the German ‘brand’ of quality and reliability.

Industry is a tricky type of business to digitise because processes move slowly, investment times for machines span into decades. In most cases the core technology has also been working reliably for almost a century; why change? A need for change to stay economically competitive is intellectually understood  but emotionally not yet felt. And the solution isn’t easy either. You can automate manufacturing, have ‘smart factories’. But this again is a chicken and egg problem. What and how exactly should you automate to stay competitive in the next century? It requires a completely new vision on manufacturing, where the incentive to do so is not really resonating. 

‘Mittelstand’ has a very similar problem. These are the small and medium sized businesses around the country, often family businesses. In it for the long haul, and often with a decades old way of doing things. Here the pain to change is not so obvious (yet). There is a lot of social cohesion to buy locally, and there remains a lot of (international) demand for German goods and services. Why change? Here also the solution is difficult, maybe even more difficult. What exactly do you need to automate? With what systems? And how do you pay for the required upfront investment?

#### Solution direction
Germany’s government can (and does) take care of the lower layers of the Maslow pyramid. It does so mainly using the “Digital Strategy 2025” program, that focuses on facilitating infrastructure investment, public-private-academic collaborations, reforming educational systems, and providing the legal frameworks (for example around privacy) for Germans and German business to start trusting and using digital technologies.

Those ‘enablers’ are key for the country to digitise. But it still leaves a key ‘gap’ that government won’t be able to fill. The gap of creating affordable digital products for SME businesses, creating affordable industry automation products for both SME and larger industrial companies and creating 

## Opportunities
The value promise of digital technologies is on the one hand on enabling new business models, and on the other hand making more efficient the way businesses deliver on their products and services. 

### Take care of the basics
The lower layers of the Maslow pyramid have been set in motion by the German government, but nonetheless offer significant opportunities. One of the most important opportunities are those around creating infrastructure. There is willingness to invest, and a strong business case (once the infrastructure is nation-wide in use). The challenge is decentralised political structure of the country, and the sheer size of some of the states. This also offers opportunities for more disruptive types of infrastructure, like satellite connectivity. Other opportunities in this areas mainly evolve around expanding best practices out of other (European) countries to e-government services. Areas like education and healthcare have more influence of government to be digitised. 

- Infrastructure development equipment, tools and innovations to build a high-speed broadband network throughout the country

- Development & design services - (specialised) agencies that create user-friendly products around health, education and other government services have a wide spread of opportunities in lots of national and decentralised government agencies to target

### Lower digitisation barrier for SME
This is the key market - enabling SME companies in Germany to digitise in a cost-effective way - is a way to significantly alter the competitive landscape. You can reasonably expect the pressure on those companies to grow over the coming ten years (as a result of European and global market competition), and that pressure will only serve as a drive to digitise. 

- Standardised and/or customisable business management software (ERP/low-code) for small and medium sized businesses.

- Off-and near-shore software development agencies/services to offer cost-competitive development services to (medium sized) businesses.

- Low-cost/standardised/customisable manufacturing automation products and services for small and medium sized manufacturing businesses to easily implement in their existing production lines.

### Raise the heat - disrupt the market
As Europe’s largest economy, where digital infrastructure is steadily developing, a lot of opportunities are created for existing digital disruptors to move into the market, or to pop up. That would means a changing of the playing field of SME companies close to home, incentivising innovation, but also 

- Supply chain and purchasing innovations to disrupt the way the fast landscape of businesses in Germany purchases, creates products, and calculates prices - ripe for disruption.

- Incubators focused on B2B industry and agriculture - whether in collaboration with large industry companies, or standalone startups, there is a big market for innovative new ideas, businesses and products that will only grow as the competitive landscape starts to shift.

- Germany as location - national and local governments are keen on remaining relevant, subsidising relocations. Centrally located in Europe, with large number of (industrial) suppliers and highly-educated workforce.

## Conclusion
Digitisation is a tricky subject, since it is mostly a cultural transition. In its core it is about believing that digital technology enables opportunities, and feeling a need to be ready to grasp those opportunities to stay relevant in a shifting global market. 

That large-scale ‘geopolitical’ view clashes with a more down-to-earth reality of having to use and implement digital tools. The concept of digital remains scary and in the core unintuitive, also costly. Without a clearly felt pain businesses that stick to tradition are unlikely to digitise. 
Where governments can (and do) facilitate infrastructure to enable networks, legal frameworks to build trust, collaboration to build knowledge, the real economic benefits of digitisations come from businesses adopting digital technology.
