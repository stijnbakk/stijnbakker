Strategy is the pinnacle of business<br/>
The pride and joy of ambitious people

Strategy is, in fact, nothing<br/>
Not really

Strategy is some form of plan<br/>
That is believed by the members of the endeavour<br/>
To give the endeavour the highest chance of success

Or, to put it more simply:<br/>
Strategy is an agreed upon goal<br/>
And an agreed upon set of limitations to achieve that goal

The trick of strategy is not defining a goal that is super unique.<br/>
It is not about exactly understanding the market, and pinning down the ‘gap in the market’.

It is simply about stakeholder management<br/>
Setting a goal<br/>
Aligning on that goal

Which sometimes means massaging ego’s<br/>
Which sometimes means giving a super analytical overwhelming presentation<br/>
Which sometimes means bringing in a super charismatic leader who’s “done it before”<br/>
Which sometimes means a stuffing down the throat of a goal

But always it should mean<br/>
Understanding how someone else might interpret a goal<br/>
Be concerned about a goal<br/>
And re-adjust the definition of that goal from their perspective and concerns

Without the goal becoming less sharp
