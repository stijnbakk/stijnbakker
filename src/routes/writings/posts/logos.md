Engineers are often skilled with images and numbers, but they may underestimate the power of words in conveying ideas. In an interview, I once heard someone say, "Engineers are good with images, good with numbers, but not so good with words. And you need words to be able to interpret something."

However, it is important to remember that if you want to change the world, you need to be able to convince others of your ideas. Words are essential in giving meaning to numbers and images. An idea may be relevant and realistic, but it is worthless if it cannot be effectively shared.

Just like the subject of a painting, an idea must be presented in a context that helps the audience interpret it favorably. This is where the art of storytelling comes in; the ability to shape images with words.

The most compelling presentations and pitches do not start with the idea itself, but with a story that creates a stage for the idea. By setting the right conditions and framing the idea, the presenter guides the audience's perception and assessment of the idea. Similar to how a passe-partout directs the viewer's gaze to a painting, the presenter frames the idea to highlight its key aspects. A great example of this art of pitching can be found in the "Don Draper carousel" scene from the TV series Mad Men.

To make an idea convincing, it should engage as many senses as possible and evoke emotions in the audience. The more senses and emotions are associated with an idea, the more memorable and impactful it becomes. This principle is similar to the memory palace technique, where sensory experiences are consciously linked to things to be remembered. A well-presented idea combines logic (represented by numbers) with emotional storytelling (represented by words) to create a powerful and memorable impression.

Returning to the trinity of images, numbers, and words, the image serves as the foundation or framework for the idea. It can be a visual representation or a description painted with words. On this framework, a story is woven, combining emotions and rational arguments to support the idea.

Why does this combination work? It may be because it engages both the right and left hemispheres of the brain. Rational arguments make an idea logical and irrefutable, while the story keeps us emotionally engaged and forms strong associations between emotions and rational arguments. This combination anchors the idea deep in our brains.

Sense-making is another aspect of life that relies on the interplay between words and interpretations. We constantly scan our environment for patterns and seek to understand and predict them. This process, known as sense-making, is limited by our brain's capacity to consciously interpret patterns. To truly understand the world, we need to articulate our interpretations into words, a process known as sense-giving. By putting our interpretations into words and sharing them, we trigger the processes that enable us to understand new things and advance human knowledge.
