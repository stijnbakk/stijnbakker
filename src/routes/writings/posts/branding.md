I think of branding not as marketing<br/>
But as framing or storytelling

As a tool<br/>
For creating meaning<br/>
Around a product, business or person

We humans live around meaning<br/>
It allows us to elevate what is,<br/>
To what it could become

Which allows us to move from reality<br/>
To aspiration<br/>
To dreaming<br/>
And emotion

It allows us to want to ally ourselves <br/>
With who or what we’d like to be

Branding is about<br/>
Designing a meaning<br/>
Designing a story

**Designing the identity of a thing**

The identity of a product<br/>
The identity of a business<br/>
The identity of a cause

With that, the brand becomes so much more than the thing itself<br/>
It becomes a canvas of aspirations

This is why startup pitches get investment without any project<br/>
Why products with insane markups get sold<br/>
Or what binds the fragile team of a startup together

A brand is about what is to be<br/>
About potential<br/>
Not about what actually is

And because it is aspirational<br/>
It's powering

Because it allows a thing that isn't <br/>
to identify and focus itself

Into a product<br/>
Into a team<br/>
Or into a business

It’s that imaginative power of a brand<br/>
To bind together<br/>
That fascinates me about branding

It fascinates me<br/>
as a tool for product development<br/>
As a tool for team motivation<br/>
As a tool for entrepreneurship

It fascinates me<br/>
for its power to make people believe

And therefore to become a self-fulfilling prophecy
