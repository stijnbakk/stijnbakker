Time and time again I have failed to define the problem.

When starting a project, you just want to start<br/>
And it feels like you get somewhere.

But always, I find, at some point would I want to return to an initial project brief.<br/>
A problem definition.<br/>
And some (vague) definition of done.

Advice to myself<br/>
Always define a project brief.<br/>
A brief that outlines the problem<br/>
A brief that outlines some initial hypothesis or deconstructed sub-questions<br/>
A brief that outlines the conditions for the project (time, budget, other)<br/>
A brief that outlines the envisioned timeline and deadline<br/>
A brief that outlines the intended definition of done (however vague)

Can be short. 100 words.<br/>
But write it.

And donâ€™t forget to return to it.
