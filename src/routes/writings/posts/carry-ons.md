Stations are fascinating<br/>
Large groups of people, zero collisions<br/>
Every person being an intuitive calculator, makin micro-adjustments to his path and speed<br/>
to avoid bumping into each other

Airports are different<br/>
Then people drag along a carry-on<br/>
Suddenly they're 2 feet longer than they're used to<br/>
And the intuitive calculator breaks down
