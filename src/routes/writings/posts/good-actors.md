# Good actors and the mirror of our emotions

Soon, a new Netflix film will be released with leading roles for Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce. I am a great admirer of both, especially Anthony Hopkins. The power with which he can play emotions, perfected to the smallest details, fascinates me. The power of Hopkins lies in his face. He becomes the character he plays, after which his face, full of wrinkles and folds, really brings that character to life. YouTuber ‘Nerdwriter’ has made a fantastic mini-documentary about him, just look it up.

But when I thought about this admiration for Hopkins, another question came to mind: Why do we put actors on a pedestal? Have we started to admire people who are known? Or is it more admiration for their profession? And what is that profession?

I believe we admire actors for two reasons. Firstly, their ability to take us into another world. Secondly, their ability to feel and show emotions.

Let me start with the first. I believe that we have come to admire actors for their ability to transport us into a totally different world. A world that is perfectly balanced by a well-written script. A world where things are just a little bit more beautiful, dramatic or heroic than in our own world. A good actor brings this world to life, and appeals to the viewer’s imagination. That actor becomes an avatar of the viewer, as it were, to be part of that world. In order to escape from our world as well.

The second reason that we have come to admire actors, I think, is because of their ability to feel and show emotions. In a world in which everything about our behaviour is supposed to be in order, to be grounded in rationality, a good actor can relieve us from that burden. We see someone who, like us, is struggling with problems and all the associated emotions. A good actor embodies those emotions, and magnifies them. In a subtle way, yet one that is clearly visible to us. By doing so, the actor holds up a mirror to us. We recognise our imperfect self in an actor’s emotional response to (everyday) struggles, and through his ability to express emotions, the actor offers us an affirmation of our own humanity.

A good actor offers us a map of how to deal with emotions. The film or play is an externalised dream. One of the reasons that we dream is to ‘simulate’ our (emotional) response to special situations, and to practice with it. A good actor with whom we identify takes us into his world, his dream, and shows us how to (not) deal with our emotions.
