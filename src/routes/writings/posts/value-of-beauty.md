This is the type of subject that could turn into something beautiful. <br/>
It's not yet. <br/>
But making it beautiful over time requires me to put out a first version. Now. <br/>
Revision over time.

As a student I was fascinated with intuition. <br/>
That interest stemmed from the way I designed products at the time.<br/>
I distinctly remeber the joy of working with [Remko Verhaagen](https://www.blooey.nl/), who was my mentor.<br/>
We seemed to share a definition of "hmm, doesn't feel quite right yet"-ness.

That felt liberating.

No analysis, argumentation required.<br/>
Just a yes or no on whether it is beautiful or not.

That feeling, I identified as intuition.

And I began to believe in my intuition. And its value. <br/>
Even though I didn't understand it. Still don't, really.

But as I moved into a more business and strategy focused master program, I became an avid advocate for the concept. <br/>
Hooked on every paper and lecture that hinted on it. I think I even wrote a paper on it myself.<br/>

I felt it held potential for complex strategic decision making.

Where the number of variables is to many to wrap your head around at the point of having to make the actual decision.<br/>
Intuition would enable you to form a mental picture of the situation, rely on that.

Where I proudly relied on intuition in the projects I worked on, <br/>
my professors were less convinced.

Intuition is fuzzy, non-scientific. <br/>
Non-argumentative, not rational.<br/>
And as such I was behind two-nill in having to defend my creations.

Enough teachers were excited by what I came up with to encourage me to continue. <br/>
But my proclaiming of my use of intuition began to fade.

You have too little experience to solely rely on intuition. I would hear. <br/>

Which, I guess is true.<br/>
Isn't it true for us all?

But I have clung to the idea of beauty and intuition ever since.<br/>
I quietly try and apply it to my work, and some personal stuff too.

Because I feel that ultimately, intuition, expressed through beauty, is the only tool I have to come up with complex concepts and ideas.<br/>
And relying on the beauty of design, mechanics, logic structuring, or layering of ideas, still to me is my most valuable asset.
