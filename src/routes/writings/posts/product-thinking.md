title: On product thinking
description: Product is different from prototype thinking. Prototyping is roaming free like an artist. Producting is designing a system to repeatedly, consistently and efficiently deliver value, again and again. Freedom vs rigidity.

A product is different from a prototype<br/>
in one way;<br/>
repetition of value delivery

Prototypes are one-off<br/>
Products are repeated<br/>
Delivered consistently in quality<br/>
and viability economically

Both hold a promise of value, their story<br/>
Both hold a delivery of value, their use<br/>

But only a product has a _system_ of delivery<br/>
that ensures delivery again and again

It is the difference between designing a car<br/>
And designing the plant to manufacture the car<br/>

(Industrial) design is therefor only a quarter about the look, feel, usefulness and value of a product<br/>
And three-quarters about the design of a system to deliver that value

And here is the tricky bit; making decisions<br/>

Prototyping is much like sculpting<br/>
Shaping around materials<br/>
Allowing a shape to emerge<br/>
Like an artist will

Prototyping is fun<br/>
It is free<br/>
Intuitive<br/>
And yields an end result

But producting is different<br/>
That shape being dreamt up<br/>
Must be created with the machines in a plant

And so a back and forth emerges<br/>
Between what the shape ought to be<br/>
And what is realistically possible

Producting is about the art of letting a shape emerge<br/>
But more so about the art of making a decision<br/>
The decision to use aluminum over steel<br/>
Or use stamping over moulding

Constraints that pose a limitation<br/>
A limitation that causes emotional friction<br/>
Particularly with artists, used to roam free

But also constraints that will move you forward<br/>
Allow your shape-search to be more focused<br/>
Allow your machine-builders to start working on their machines

Decisions then, like in any organisation<br/>
Are the culprit of stagnation<br/>
And the true challenge of producting

The back and forth between sculting and system design<br/>
Is a funnel of decisions, <br/>
narrowing down onto the final product

That means keeping the end in mind<br/>
Concretely, in how the product will function, feel and look<br/>
But more importantly; abstractly

The value promise is the guidance for every decision
