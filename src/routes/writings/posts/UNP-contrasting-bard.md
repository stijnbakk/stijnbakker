We make sense of the world through words, <br/>
Stories conjured up with those words <br/>

For an idea to truly settle in the brain, <br/>
like a bard<br/>
something has to be a paradox<br/>

Impossibly true and false at the same time<br/>
A combination of 2 words that each conjure up a story, by association<br/>
As story that is impossible to resolve<br/>
And thus will fascinate the brain time and time again <br/>

This is a powerful concept, in particular for branding<br/>
