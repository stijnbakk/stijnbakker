Starting June 2023 I will start an experiment; a monthly newsletter. My key slow takes of the things I observe and think about during the month. Thoughts on entrepreneurship, (European) policy and tech. All in one small and simple newsletter.

But before I start I wanted to document and share with you my motivation:

## Accountability tool

This will be a tool to force myself to condense my thoughts into actionable insights and conclusions, every month. I spend a lot of time reading, writing and thinking every week. Yet it is difficult for me to make those thoughts concrete. Capture them in time. Put on paper. To be reviewed later.

The newsletter is a format that allows me to be a bit more loose in capturing my thoughts, yet also forces me to be concrete. Not as concrete as having a full essay on a single topic, but concrete enough to log my observations and predicitions to a point in time.

Thus, it is a tool for myself to document conclusions, research them later. And a tool to distill out the most valuable bits, and share them with you.

## Different viewpoints

At the core I'm just curious. About things, but mostly about people. What do others think? But weirdly, that requires me to first share my perspective. (Thanks Derek Sivers for the insight).

I always fear my viewpoint is a bit out there. A bit too radical. A bit too unnuanced. But only by putting it out there can I invite people to critique it.

## Hone my skills and fears

I write almost every day. Yet I never dare to publish. Afraid of the real-world feedback I guess. On my writing, my thoughts, my interests. Time to step up that game. Time to publish. Make my writing sharper. Maybe see if it sticks..

### Definition of Success

Lastly, this is an experiment. When is it a success? If I feel it sharpens my thinking, and allows me to become more concrete. If the newsletter enables me to capture my cloud of thoughts my thoughts and observations.

And most of all, I hope you guys find my thoughts remotely useful and/or interesting!
