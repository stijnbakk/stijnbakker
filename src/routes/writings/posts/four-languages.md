I describe four language we speak<br/>
Not to communicate amongst each other<br/>
But to provide the grammar of our thinking

## Science

Exact, as spoken by progressionals<br/>
Expressing itself in absolutes<br/>
Focus on material stuff

A language in which casual relationships are drawn<br/>
Hypotheses made

This is the language of control<br/>
Capturing the workings of the world in laws and rules<br/>

## Law

As spoken by lawyers, adminstrators and politicians<br/>
Focus not on exactitudes, but reasoning<br/>
On sequentiality of words and sentences<br/>
And the emotions they evoke

The language that focuses on what can be<br/>
Not what is

A contract is drafted and tested from different scenarios<br/>
As is a law

A politician focuses on what should be<br/>
What is to come<br/>
And cannot yet be now

## Logic

The language of programmers<br/>
Closely linked eto science, <br/>
But a hybrid with the language of law

Programmers capture a problem in repeatable cubes, logically coherent<br/>
They focus on what's to come, and structure code in such a way that what is to happend won't fail

It's the language of building<br/>
Moving forward<br/>
Stepping forward from what is,<br/>
and into what's going to be

## Spirituality

The knot in your stomach<br/>
Intuition<br/>
Or simply raw emotions

The language that ties everything together<br/>
And provides us with meaning<br/>
and peace of mind

The language we don't want to talk about<br/>
A language without logic or exactness<br/>
A language without control<br/>
A language so personal we are unable to defend it with arguments

A language we do not control<br/>
And do not understand<br/>
Or don't even want to understand
