I have three ‘modes’ through which I work, and continually have to work.

- I phrase
- I architect
- I design

For basically every problem I take on, I must remind myself to switch between ‘modes’, to prevent myself from getting stuck.

## Phrasing

Phrasing can take the shape of a piece of text, or a verbal explanation<br/>
It can take the shape of a poem, or prose<br/>
And within that, it can be conversational, or ‘presenter’-like<br/>
To simply describe a problem or solution<br/>
Look for the words<br/>
Fail to find words<br/>
And stumble across analogies<br/>
I find myself finding new perspectives

Remind yourself to phrase what you’re thinking

## Architecting

Architecting is the act of abstractly deconstructing the problem<br/>
In a flowchart or outline<br/>
Or sometimes code<br/>
It’s breaking the problem and solution up into logical sequence of steps<br/>
Thus making the problem smaller and smaller<br/>
To eventually stumble on a new insight<br/>
Or simply the realisation that things are simpler than they seem

Remind yourself to logically break down a problem, and visualise the elements<br/>

## Designing

Designing is the act of visualising a solution, so that it takes shape in your head<br/>
It can be a simple sketch<br/>
Or an advanced rendering<br/>
A first imperfect approximation<br/>
Of what the solution could look like

And in designing and creating that visualisation<br/>
You immediately see the bits where things don’t make sense<br/>
Note those down, as areas to think deeper

Remind yourself to design the end solution, looking as if it were done.
