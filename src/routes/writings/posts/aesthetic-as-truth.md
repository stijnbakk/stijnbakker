There is this weird concept when you’re lost in a problem or life<br/>
Viewing something as a sort of art form

To find some sort of beauty<br/>
In a text, a visual, or logic

It can be beauty at its’ most basic<br/>
The text formatting looks good<br/>
The sentences flow nicely<br/>
A visual simply looks balanced and beautiful<br/>
Or the logic looks elegant

In math<br/>
There is the concept of beauty<br/>
The most groundbreaking formula’s<br/>
Are also often the simplest<br/>
And most beautiful to look at

I’ve found the same to be true for design<br/>
And programming<br/>
And writing

It’s a feeling I’ve long relied on<br/>
To judge whether or not I’m on the right track

It’s also a feeling I’ve learned to shut up about<br/>
Because when you’re just starting out, nobody will trust your intuition

Instead, I learned to use intuition and beauty as an internal compass<br/>
Only then to learn to reason and argument around the result<br/>
Then to have my suggestions and recommendations implemented<br/>
Then to have my recommendations be successful

To over time build up credibility<br/>
To the point where the people I work with<br/>
More and more start to trust my intuition

Which is ultimately guided by my hunting for beauty
