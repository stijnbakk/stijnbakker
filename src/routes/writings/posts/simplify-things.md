When I graduated I took pride in the complexity of the subject I had graduated on.<br/>
Aligning autonomous teams in a scaling organisation.<br/>
My professor was less impressed.<br/>
He instilled in me that it was my job to simplify things.<br/>
Without losing the essence or its core.

After this advice I started as a strategy consultant.<br/>
For many years I took pride in my ability to handle complex abstract projects, software architectures, theories and corporate political dynamics.<br/>
It turned out I was wrong.

Because for all my love of complexity,<br/>
Once I noticed how other colleagues had the same tendency<br/>
And once I noticed how that complexity-tendency led to confused customers, stretched timelines and missed deals
I realised my professor was right.

I view it as my task to simplify complex situations.<br/>
I still take pride in my ability to understand complex abstract projects, software architectures, theories and corporate political dynamics.<br/>
But I take even more pride in simplifying them down.<br/>
Evaluating the situation, and quickly coming to a set of actionable steps.<br/>
And a few questions to deeper explore.

I find that simplifying brings calmth and action to the teams I work in.<br/>
It helps us get things done.<br/>
Which in turn gives everyone a feeling of satisfaction.

Simplify.<br/>
Later more on how to do that.
