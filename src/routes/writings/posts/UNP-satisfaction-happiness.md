Don't aim for happiness<br/>
Aim for satisfaction instead

Happiness are the fleeting moments of joy you experience<br/>
They don't repeat themselves, even if you put yourself in the same situation

Therefor, aiming for happiness is pointless<br/>
It's not sustainable<br/>
It's something to be alert for, thankful for

But the real pursuit must lie in satisfaction<br/>
However you define that

Satisfaction = effort worthwhile

Deploying your first website
Graduating your program
Fixing the drawer in the kitchen
Helping something

Define 'worthwhile' anyway you like<br/>

The point is that doing effort, <br/>
with a worthwhile payoff, <br/>
ultimately makes you a much sustainably happier person
