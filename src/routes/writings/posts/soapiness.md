People can be aggressive in imposing opinions<br/>
Convinced they're right<br/>
And sometimes their righteousness can hurt<br/>
Why is that?

But as a rule of thumb, I remind myself that<br/>
The more aggressively an opinion is forced<br/>
The higher the insecurity of the person who forces it

People tend to look for peers<br/>
If someone else believes what you believe, you're not alone<br/>
Group pressure<br/>
The greater the group, the greater the safety<br/>

The need for safety rests only on insecurity

Which we all have<br/>
Some are better at pretending that they don't<br/>
Or pretending to themselves

Evangelists want to shed light upon your ignorance<br/>
Your happy, peaceful ignorance<br/>
Break the perspective and provide a new one<br/>
Theirs

Because ultimately, I think we're continually trying to find a perspective that guides us through life<br/>
And as we find one and succeed in life, we become convinced of the usefulness of that perspective<br/>
We push it onto others as useful advice<br/>
Forgetting that for someone else, in other times and other circumstances, there might be a better perspective elsewhere

I've always been jealous of evangelic friends<br/>
I feel they have a base perspective that allows them to continually question everything<br/>
Peaceful<br/>
Just focus on the work to be done

Yet even those perspectives can break or shift<br/>
And then you have to search and find again

Ultimately, I view life as a contemplation<br/>
I prefer to continually look for new fresh perspectives<br/>
Trying them on, seeing what fits
