Corporations provide mostly commodity services<br/>
Groceries, packages, banking services, even taxes<br/>

We used to think of a commodity as a bad thing<br/>
Invisible, therefore boring, therefore not worth a 'premium' pricetag<br/>

But maybe that's changed a little bit<br/>
With the proliferation of "my" environments

Your supermarket, bank, government, delivery service now tries to be 'yours'<br/>
Not just in the commodity they provide,<br/>
But more in the sense of a digital butler<br/>
A personalised grocery list, account expense report, customisable delivery options

And all of those services are branded as 'my'<br/>
"Mijn Albert Heijn", "Mijn ING", "Mijn Overheid"<br/>

How will digital-blended businesses change the way commodities are branded?
