I like to write<br/>
It helps me think, structure thoughts<br/>

Sometimes I like my thoughts<br/>
Sometimes even enough to consider sharing them

But sharing to me is a paradox<br/>
A box of fear<br/>
Of sharing thoughts incomplete<br/>
Incorrect, or inconsiderate

Yet I do force myself to publish<br/>
knowing thinking is never done

#### Why I write

I write to capture snippets of thoughts<br/>
Form them into a somewhat coherent mess<br/>
Shape that into insights and ideas

From shapeless to shapeful<br/>
Capturing hunges puts my mind at ease<br/>
And saves those snippets for use later

#### Why I publish

I force myself to publish<br/>
to become concrete in articulating the idea<br/>
to become clear in explaining the insight<br/>
to invite perspectives I haven't considered<br/>
to pinpoint opinion to a point in time

thus putting the idea to rest<br/>
knowing it is concrete enough to be picked up later<br/>
knowing it is clear enough and might provide some value<br/>
knowing my thinking is fallible, and will be challenged<br/>
knowing my hunge is recorded, and can develop over time

#### Finally

Every thing I put out<br/>
I view as a point on a scatterplot<br/>
As a point not much worth in itself<br/>
but as a cluster valuable as a theory<br/>
and as a line, valuable as a trend or observation
