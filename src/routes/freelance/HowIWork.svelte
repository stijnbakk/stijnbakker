		<h3>1. Company deep-dive</h3>
        <p>I want to know everything about your company, goals. Why? To help you
		integrate it all, turn your strategy into a product and new organisation.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>2. Design, iterate, integrate </h3>
        <p>I start ‘designing’ a plan, and a product concept, development
		backlog, and a marketing plan, all at the same time. Together with you. They click together like
		a puzzle.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>3. Inspire and start </h3>
        <p>Ultimately it is time to say ‘start’. Wrap things up into a very clear
		to-do list, an inspiring presentation. And I leave you and your experts to it.</p>
