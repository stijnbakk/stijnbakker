			Legal stuff shouldn't be complicated or expensive

			<p>Legal issues can be thorny. And expensive. In particular for non-corporates.</p>
			<p>
				For SME companies the law is still a messy spaghetti of rules and don'ts. A thing to be
				feared.
			</p>
			<p class="font-bold">
				I believe it shouldn't be. Law shouldn't be difficult. It can be easy.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a lot of legal stuff you as an entrepreneur can do yourself, just with some logical
				thinking and a few tools. Lawry provides those tools and examples, a bit of guidance, for a
				fraction of the cost of a real lawyer.
			</p>
			<p>
				And when you do need a real lawyer. To check the end result, or to consult on a very
				particular problem, Lawry can help you make sense of the web of legal firms and lawyers.
